July 13, 2022

# Discription

Made a employee work day scheduler.  This scehduler is for employees to use.  It will show the past hours, current hours and present hours by highlighting in different colors.

# Acceptance Criteria

* When I up the planner the current day is displayed.
* When I scroll down I am presented with time blocks of the current work day.
* When I view those time blocks, each is color coded for past, present and future.
* When I click on the time-block I want, I will be able to enter and event and save it.
* That event twill be saved to local storage.
* When I refresh the page the event that is saved still persists.

# About
